To have a context dataset for diverse lineages, on 2024-DEC-19, I selected at least two
sequences to represent each clade from the Nextstrain 12-year build. I selectede one
temporally early sequence and one temporally late sequence. Then, I selected a few
more sequences from Clade V1A.3a.2 to represent the diversity of that clade, since
this is all that has circulated in recent years.

I downloaded these from GISAID and annotated them with their clade name at the end of
the FASTA header.
